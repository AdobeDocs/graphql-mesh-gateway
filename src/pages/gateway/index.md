# What is API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder? (BETA)

API Mesh enables developers to integrate third-party APIs with other Adobe products, like App Builder, Adobe IO Gateway, or other serverless technologies.

By integrating multiple APIs, developers can allow these external systems to synchronize data, and participate in distributed workflows.

API Mesh allows developers to configure multiple APIs and other sources and serve them through a gateway. Developers can query the combined sources through a single GraphQL query.
