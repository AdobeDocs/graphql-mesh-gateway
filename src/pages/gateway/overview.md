# What is Adobe Graph?

Adobe Graph is a decoupled API platform that enables enterprise and mid-market developers to integrate private or third-party APIs and other software interfaces with Adobe products using Adobe IO. This allows businesses that need to access functionality across multiple systems to provide better end-user experiences. Adobe Graph is [Multi-Tenant], which means developers can configure multiple APIs and other sources and serve them through a single gateway. Developers can query the combined sources through a single [GraphQL] query. Adobe Commerce, for example, also [supports GraphQL queries].

Adobe Graph enables developers to integrate a GraphQL Mesh or third-party APIs with other Adobe products, like App Builder, Adobe IO Gateway, or other serverless technologies. By subscribing to near-real-time events, developers can allow these external systems to synchronize data, participate in distributed workflows, and generally react to events as they occur.

[GraphQL] is a query language for your API that lets you query exactly the information you need and only the information you need. [GraphQL Mesh] allows you to use GraphQL to query multiple data sources simultaneously.

## Why GraphQL?

[GraphQL] has several advantages over REST and other APIs:

-  **GraphQL has predictable responses**: With GraphQL, you specify what information your response should contain.
-  **Faster response time**: Since you can control what data appears in your response, there is less extraneous data slowing down your calls.
-  **Defined Schema**: With its well-defined set of types, GraphQL lets you know what data you can query.

## Features

-  **Adobe Graph** - A reverse proxy that accepts most API calls for many backend services
-  **Configurable Integrations** - Low/No-code method to integrate with your own private APIs with Adobe Commerce and other Adobe products, and third-party APIs
<!-- The two features below likely refer to the App Builder and may need to be deleted before beta -->
-  **Backwards Compatibility** - Preserve existing APIs while gradually adopting new ones
-  **Extensibility** - Customize and extend all of your APIs directly in the gateway without making changes to the API source

## Example use case

Adobe Commerce users can consider Adobe Graph as a low-code way to integrate other APIs to the Storefront and Storefront Management APIs. It also provides a way for the Storefront API and the Storefront Management APIs to communicate with each other.
