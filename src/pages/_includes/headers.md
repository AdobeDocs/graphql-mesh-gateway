You can pass dynamic header values at runtime or by including them in your mesh. If you want to add headers directly to the query, see [runtime headers](/src/pages/gateway/headers/#add-or-update-headers-at-runtime).

-  Expressions inside dynamic values should be in javascript.
-  Environment variables are not supported.
