# Handlers

The documentation in this folder was originally published by [The Guild] at https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/. We are republishing it here under the [MIT License] because Adobe Graph uses an older version of GraphQL Mesh and the documentation at that site reflects the current version. Additionally, we currently only support a limited set of handlers, transforms, and recipes.

The links below contain specific information on setting up different types of handlers in GraphQL Mesh:

-  Handlers
   -  [OpenAPI]
   -  [GraphQL]
   -  [JSON Schemas]

[Source Handlers] provides more information about handlers in the context of Adobe Graph].
