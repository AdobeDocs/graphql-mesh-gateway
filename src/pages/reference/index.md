# GraphQL Mesh documentation

The GraphQL Mesh documentation was originally published by [The Guild] at https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/. We are republishing it here under the [MIT License] because Adobe Graph uses an older version of GraphQL Mesh and the documentation at that site reflects the current version. Additionally, we currently only support a limited set of handlers, transforms, and recipes.
