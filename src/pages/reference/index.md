# GraphQL Mesh documentation

This reference documentation was originally published by [The Guild] in their [GraphQL Mesh Docs]. API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder uses the GraphQL Mesh library. You can use the documentation in this section to customize your mesh as needed.

We are republishing the GraphQL Mesh documentation here under the [MIT License] because the API Mesh uses an older version of GraphQL Mesh, while the documentation on their site only reflects the current version. Additionally, we currently only support a limited set of handlers, transforms, and recipes.
