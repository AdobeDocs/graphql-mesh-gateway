# GraphQL Mesh documentation

This reference documentation was originally published by [The Guild] in their [GraphQL Mesh Docs]. We are republishing it here under the [MIT License] because Adobe Graph uses an older version of GraphQL Mesh, while the documentation at that site reflects the current version. Additionally, we currently only support a limited set of handlers, transforms, and recipes.
