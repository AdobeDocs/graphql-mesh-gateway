# API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder

API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder is a decoupled API platform that enables enterprise and mid-market developers to integrate private and third-party APIs and other software interfaces with Adobe products using Adobe IO.

API Mesh allows developers to combine multiple data sources into a single GraphQL endpoint. Unlike working with APIs, the GraphQL query language lets you determine the information the response contains.

By serving multiple sources through a single gateway and providing customized responses, API Mesh creates a better end-user experience for accessing your backend services.

## Features

<br></br>

-  **Adobe API Manager** - A reverse proxy that accepts most API calls for many backend services
-  **Configurable Integrations** - Low/No-code method to integrate with your own private APIs with Adobe Commerce, other Adobe products, and third-party APIs
-  **Backwards Compatibility** - Preserve existing APIs while gradually adopting new ones
-  **Extensibility** - Customize and extend your APIs directly in the gateway without making changes to the API source
