## Overview

Adobe Graph allows businesses to access functionality across multiple systems to provide better end-user experiences. Adobe Graph is Multi-Tenant, which means developers can configure multiple APIs and other sources and serve them through a single gateway. Developers can query the combined sources through a single [GraphQL] query. Adobe Commerce, for example, also [supports GraphQL queries].
