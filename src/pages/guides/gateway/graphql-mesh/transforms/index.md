# Transforms (GraphQL Mesh)

The documentation in this folder was originally published by [The Guild] at https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/. We are republishing it here under the [MIT License] because Adobe Graph uses an older version of GraphQL Mesh and the documentation at that site reflects the current version. Additionally, we currently only support a limited set of handlers, transforms, and recipes.

The links below contain specific information on setting up different types of transforms in GraphQL Mesh:

-  Transforms
   -  [Introduction]
   -  [Encapsulate]
   -  [Extend]
   -  [Federation]
   -  [Filter schema]
   -  [Naming Convention]
   -  [Prefix]
   -  [Rename]
   -  [Replace Field]
   -  [Type Merging]

If you would like more information on transforms in the context of Adobe Graph, please refer to [Transforms].
